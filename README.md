# asg2svg
ASCII GRAPHICS (a set of ASCII Text, to create Vector Graphics in SVG format )

A new approach to software projects with only one file.

.asg : ASCII GRAPHICS (a set of ASCII Text, to create Vector Graphics in SVG format )


## Motivation

- Make it as simple as possible.

Do you believe that it is possible to write a graphic program with only 250 "lines of code",

which can be executed on any machine with Perl (https://www.perl.org/) Interpreter and without any additional libraries?

Here is a single file tool <asg2svg.pl> in that everything is included.

- Draw your graphics easily without a mouse and graphical interface simply in a text editor.

-  You can easily generate simple graphics automatically from ".asg file" and include them in your HTML document.

The generated ".svg file" can be viewed with any modern web browser. (My favorite one is: https://astian.org/en/midori-browser/)

A simple DEMO drawing can be generated with <asg2svg.pl>.

Simply run it in a console (with Perl installation).

```
./asg2svg.pl -demo
```
and you get:

```
# NOTE [./asg2svg.pl]: Image generated ..: s.  demo.svg & demos.svg
```

"ASG Format" can be easily understood through the "DEMO-File" <demo.asg> generated by <./asg2svg.pl>.


If <./asg2svg.pl> not running, check your Perl installation and set the installation path in the "head line" of <asg2svg.pl>.

default "head line" ist:
```
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
```
you can change it to:
```
eval 'exec perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
                if 0;
```
to find Perl automatically

or set the path: e.g.
```
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
```
to your installation.



Enjoy!
